### Hey, I'm pumkin 👋🎃

❤️ Rust & Kotlin

- 🔭 I’m currently working on [chemcreator](https://github.com/pumken/chemcreator)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning [Rust](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust)
- 👯 I’m looking to contribute to libraries like [`ruscii`](https://github.com/lemunozm/ruscii)
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with software architecture and functional programming, I guess
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him
- ⚡ Fun fact: my first language was Java. I didn't learn another language for _4 years_. I somehow escaped with my sanity intact.
